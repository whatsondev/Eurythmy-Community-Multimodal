Level 1: Evidence Generator

This module generates crash site evidence (soil sample, flora video, star field)
based on your coordinates. The evidence characteristics match your biome,
which the ADK agent will later analyze to deduce your location.

Run this at the start of Level 1 to create your personalized evidence.
