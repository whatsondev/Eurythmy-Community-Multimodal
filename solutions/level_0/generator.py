Level 0: Avatar Generator

This module generates your unique space explorer avatar using
multi-turn image generation with Gemini (Nano Banana) for
character consistency across portrait and icon.

This is the COMPLETE SOLUTION. If you're doing the codelab,
use the version in level_0/generator.py instead.

- Digital illustration style, clean lines, vibrant saturated colors
- Futuristic but weathered space suit with visible mission patches
- Background: Pure solid white (#FFFFFF) - absolutely no gradients, patterns, or elements
- Frame: Head and shoulders only, 3/4 view facing slightly left
- Lighting: Soft diffused studio lighting, no harsh shadows
- Expression: Determined but approachable
- Art style: Modern animated movie character portrait (similar to Pixar or Dreamworks style)

The white background is essential - the avatar will be composited onto a map."""
